    * Updated Swagger for IA-Connect 9.3 release
    
    Updated Swagger for IA-Connect 9.3 release: JML connector
    
    NOTE: For all actions that have new inputs, the API acts as per the previous version if you don't provide this inputs. This means that existing flows will not break. This has been extensively tested.
    NOTE: For all actions that have new outputs, these are in addition to the existing outputs and simply make new flows simpler (by providing you with more information) but does not impact existing flows. Again this has been extensively tested.
    
    ActiveDirectoryAddADUser has new outputs: CreatedUserDistinguishedName, CreatedUserSAMAccountName, CreatedUserPrincipalName
    ActiveDirectoryAddADUserToMultipleADGroupsByName has new input MaxGroupsPerCall
    ActiveDirectoryResetADUserPasswordByIdentity has new input ResetPasswordTwice
    ActiveDirectoryRemoveADUserFromMultipleADGroupsByNamehas new input MaxGroupsPerCall
    OpenExchangePowerShellRunspace has new inputs OnlyConnectIfNotAlreadyConnected, CommandTypesToImportLocally, AdditionalCommandsToImportLocallyCSV
    IsExchangePowerShellRunspaceOpen has new input TestCommunications
    Added new action ExchangeSetMailboxAutoReplyConfiguration
    Added new actions AzureADv2AddAzureADUser, AzureADv2ResetAzureADUserPassword
    AzureADv2GetAzureADUserGroupMembership has new input PropertiesToReturn
    AzureADv2AddUserToGroup and AzureADv2RemoveUserFromGroup have a default changed for the input CheckUserGroupMembershipsFirst (was false, now true). This is was changed because the Swagger was incorrect: The default for the action was actually true but accidently set to false in the previous Swagger.
    Added new actions AzureADv2AddADUserToMultipleADGroups, AzureADv2RemoveADUserFromMultipleADGroups
    AzureADv2RemoveUserFromAllGroups has new input MaxAzureADGroupsPerCall
    AzureADv2SetAzureADUser has new inputs FaxNumber, AgeGroup, ConsentProvidedForMinor, MailNickName, EmployeeId
    Added new actions AzureADv2ResetAzureADUserProperties, AzureADv2NewSecurityGroup, AzureADv2RemoveSecurityGroup, AzureADv2NewMicrosoft365Group, AzureADv2GetGroups, AzureADv2EnableUser, AzureADv2DisableUser
    Actions OpenO365PowerShellRunspace and OpenO365PowerShellRunspaceWithCertificate have new inputs OnlyConnectIfNotAlreadyConnected, CommandTypesToImportLocally, AdditionalCommandsToImportLocallyCSV
    Action IsO365PowerShellRunspaceOpen has new input TestCommunications
    Action O365NewO365DistributionGroup has new outputs CreatedGroupDN, CreatedGroupGUID, CreatedGroupIdentity
    Added new actions O365RemoveDistributionGroup, O365SetO365MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration
    Added new action JMLConnectToJMLEnvironment
    
    * Removed SID and GUID example values
    
    SID and GUID example values are not supported (in descriptions) so they were removed / replaced by a string phrase.

    [VirusTotal] Applying OpenAPI fixes
    
    There are two issues:
    1.      The API operation VirusTotalGetIpScanV3 response requires the property body/data/attributes/tags to be of type String but is of type Array; we should update to the correct type (array).
    2.      The API operation VirusTotalRetrieveInfo response is missing required property body/data/attributes/results/ADMINUSLabs; we should remove the required properties from responses if is not 100% certain that it will contain them.

    Replace default responses by expected status codes
    
    Follow the recommandation of Srikanth: please replace the "default" responses with expected status codes, otherwise users may see errors about incorrect schema instead of real error responses from your service in OpenAPI mode.
